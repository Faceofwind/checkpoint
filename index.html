        <h1><strong>Electric Cars</strong></h1>
        
        <ul>
            <li>An electric car or electric vehicle (EV) is a passenger automobile that is propelled by an electric
                traction motor,<br> using electrical energy as the primary source of propulsion <br> The term normally
                refers to a plug-in electric vehicle, typically a battery electric vehicle (BEV), <br> which only uses
                energy stored in on-board battery packs, but broadly may also include plug-in hybrid electric vehicle
                (PHEV), range-extended electric vehicle (REEV) and fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), <br> which can
                convert electric power from other fuels via a generator or a fuel cell.</li>

                <dl>Almost on its own, Tesla has proven that electric vehicles can be desirable, combining outstanding
                    performance and high-tech interiors with usable driving range <br> The Model X crossover has room
                    for up to seven. It’s also the most expensive Tesla, featuring the unique Falcon Wing doors. <br>
                    You have your pick of two sedans: the larger, more expensive Model S is a hot rod. <br> The smaller,
                    less pricey Model 3 Performance isn’t far behind. The company has also revealed its wildly styled
                    pickup truck, the Cybertruck.</dl>

            <dl>BMWs have always relied on their mostly great engines for the soul and sensation we all crave, as well
                as their dynamics, <br> but the focus is shifting elsewhere now. <br> The new 7 Series has arguably the
                finest interior in the automotive world, beautifully executed, well-made and imaginative. <br> You can
                argue among yourselves about the exterior design, but inside is a knock-out.</dl>

            <h1>Electric Cars Advantages</h1>
            <li><STRong>Electric cars have numerous advantages over traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
                    vehicles, both for individual drivers and society at large. Here are some key benefits:</STRong>
            </li>

        </ul>
        <ol type="I">
            <li><strong>Environmental Benefits</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced Emissions: Electric vehicles (EVs) produce zero tailpipe emissions, which can help reduce
                    air pollution and greenhouse gases, <br> especially if the electricity used is generated from
                    renewable sources.</li>
                <li>Lower Carbon Footprint: When powered by clean energy, electric cars significantly reduce carbon
                    emissions compared to gasoline vehicles, <br> contributing to climate change mitigation.</li>
                <li>Less Noise Pollution: EVs are quieter than traditional cars, leading to reduced noise pollution,
                    especially in urban areas.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Lower Operating Costs</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cheaper Fuel: Electricity is generally less expensive than gasoline on a per-mile basis, making EVs
                    cheaper to "fuel" over time.</li>
                <li>Lower Maintenance Costs: Electric cars have fewer moving parts than ICE vehicles, <br> leading to
                    lower maintenance and repair costs (no oil changes, fewer parts to replace, etc.).</li>
                <li>Incentives and Tax Breaks: Many governments offer tax credits, rebates, and other incentives for
                    purchasing EVs, <br> which can reduce the initial purchase cost.</li>


            </ul>
           
            <li><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong></li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Higher Efficiency: Electric motors are more energy-efficient than internal combustion engines, <br>
                    converting more of the energy stored in batteries to power the wheels.</li>
                <li>Regenerative Braking: Most EVs are equipped with regenerative braking systems, <br> which capture
                    and reuse energy during braking, further improving efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
